* Mixture Ratio (MR) is constant  
  * ISP(MR,PC) is approximately equal to ISP(PC)  
* Efficiency of Engine is 75%  
* K (cp/cv) is constant inside chamber  
  * K(MR,PC) is approximately 1.1409  
  * Range of k is 1.209 to 1.217  
* Thrust is held constant 
  * 700lbf estimate from Flight Dynamics  
* Wall thickness for the engine is double of what hoop stress dictates  
  * Not very scientific  
  * Yield stress of Copper taken at 700K
